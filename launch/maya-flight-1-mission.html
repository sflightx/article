    <p>sFlightX launched the first flight of Maya lifted off at January 20, 2024 at Droo. The booster supporting this mission was the first Booster Block 2.</p>
    <p>Maya Two concluded the mission after falling short to orbital velocity, more likely due to booster chamber pressure issues that did not meet to reach desired velocity before separation of second stage. The second stage did reach beyond expectations after reaching 20,000m/s, far from estimated.</p>
    <p>This mission, counts as sFlightX's 1st launch attempt and our 1st orbital launch of 2024.</p>
