    <p>Maya Block 2 lifted off at April 03, 2024 8:30PM PhST (12:30 UTC) for the launch of Maya Flight 4 into space. This mission carries 1 OmegaSat-mini, a smaller version of our satellite. </p>
    <p>No hardware will be recovered, but the booster is expected to execute a soft targeted splashdown ~30km downrange the launchpad.</p>
    <p>This mission will also feature a no-sep mechanism if flight computers detect deviation to expected trajectory.</p>
    <p>This 2nd-last inaugural flight of Maya verifies her capabilities for rapid reusability, before going to be fully operational.</p>
    <p>This mission, counts as sFlightX's 5th launch attempt and our 4th orbital launch of 2024.</p>
