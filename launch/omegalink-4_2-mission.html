    <p>sFlightX is targeted to launch 10 OmegaLink v6 Experimental Satellites aboard Maya NET 
        July 16, 2024 at 14:35 UTC. Version 6 Satellites carry working antennas to build a low latency 
        communications on Low Earth Orbit.</p>
    <p>Live webcast starts 10 minutes before the liftoff.</p>
    <p>This mission, counts as sFlightX's 14th launch attempt and 13th orbital launch of 2024. Numerous upgrades are visible between today's flight and the previous one, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/93KdaD76BR4?si=sJYogQEWyeDi52CE">DSS-1 Mission</a>.</p>
    <p>The Pad being used is the Old Pad where Block 3 and Block 4 lifted off last April and May. During the static fire, 2 engines showed unfavorable conditions. These engines were produced as early prototype engine before flights at BSC has already commenced.</p>

    <p>A new landing sequence will debut this flight. After stage separation, the booster will not attempt a boostback burn. 6 minutes after the launch, the booster will attempt reentry burn, stripping its descent velocity over a half for a precise aerodynamic descent.</p>
    <p>7 to 8 minutes after the flight, the booster will initiate the landing burn 5 kilometers above the ground, from 3,600 km/h.</p>
    <p>With more and more flights, this give us confidence for a rapid, reusable rockets in Juno: New Origins in the future!</p>
