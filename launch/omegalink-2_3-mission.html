    <p>sFlightX and DAXT are currently targeting 8:00PM PhST (12:00 UTC) for the launch of Maya 4 Block 2.1 and Gripen (consecutively) into space. This mission carries 2 OmegaSat-mini v4 for Maya 4, a smaller version of our satellite. Gripen will launch 8 OmegaSat v4 to LEO.</p>
    <p>For Maya 4:</p>
    <p>• No hardware will be recovered, as we are pushing the rocket's performance at its maximum.</p>
    <p>• This mission will also feature a no payload sep mechanism if flight computers detect deviation to expected trajectory.</p>
    <p>• This last inaugural flight of Maya Block 2.1 verifies her capabilities for rapid reusability, before going to be fully operational with Block 3.</p>

    <p>For Gripen:</p>
    <p>This is the second flight of Gripen and also first flight of G1003, Booster that will attempt to reenter earth´s atmosphere.</p>
    <p>This mission, counts as sFlightX's 6th launch attempt and our 5th orbital launch of 2024.</p>
